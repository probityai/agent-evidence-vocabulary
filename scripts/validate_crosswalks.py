"""Validate every file in crosswalk/ against vocabulary.yaml.

Design constraint, stated explicitly because it is the reason this script
exists: a validator that silently skips a file it doesn't recognize is worse
than no validator, because a filed crosswalk in the wrong shape then reads as
correct to anyone reading the directory while contributing nothing. Every file in
crosswalk/ (except TEMPLATE.yaml) MUST either pass validation or fail loudly
with a nonzero exit code. There is no third, silent outcome.

Run: python3 scripts/validate_crosswalks.py
Exit 0: every crosswalk file is valid.
Exit 1: at least one crosswalk file failed validation; see stderr for which
        file and which check.
Exit 2: the run could not happen. The registry is unreadable or one of its
        closed vocabularies is missing, so NOTHING was checked. This is kept
        distinct from exit 1 on purpose: a check that failed and a check that
        never ran are different states, and collapsing them lets a broken
        checker be read as a strict one.

#: registered states; this validator saw the three it had been told about, and
#: the two answers never had to agree. `out_of_scope` says a verifier MUST reject
#: an unregistered enum value, so the registry was publishing one against its own
#: rule and its own checker could not see it.
