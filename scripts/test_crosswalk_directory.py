"""Hold the validator to its promise that every file in crosswalk/ is read.

The validator's docstring says a file it does not recognize fails loudly. Until
0.3.0 it read `*.yaml` only, so the first filing's JSON and Markdown sidecars sat in
the directory unread, and the template targeted a registry version two releases
old. This builds a directory per case in a temporary location, points the real
validator's directory functions at it, and requires each wrong layout to be refused
by name and the right one to pass. No rule is reimplemented here.

Exit 0 every case behaves, 1 at least one does not, 2 the check could not run.
