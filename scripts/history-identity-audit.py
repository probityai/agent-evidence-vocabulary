"""Audit the whole published history for a private path, a dossier name or a product name.

The pre-push scan beside this one gates what is ABOUT to be pushed. This one
reads what already HAS been: every commit `origin/main` reaches, first commit to
tip, with the same rules and the same rule sidecar, so a leak that walked past
an older guard is found by the schedule, not by a reader. It is the
instrument that would have named the four 2026-09 commits the day they landed.

    scripts/history-identity-audit.py              # origin/main, end to end
    scripts/history-identity-audit.py --ref HEAD   # another ref

Exit codes, three-valued for the same reason as the pre-push scan:

    0  every commit scanned, nothing found (the count is printed)
    1  at least one commit carries a hit (commit, file and line are printed)
    2  did not scan -- the ref is absent, the sidecar failed to load, or git failed

The rules live in `pre-push-identity-scan.py` and are loaded from that file
by path, so there is exactly one rule set and the two scanners cannot disagree.
