"""Resolve the revision range a push-range identity scan must cover.

The scan beside this one reads every commit a push carries. Which commits those
are is not a question the scanner can answer: it depends on what the remote held
before the push, and only the event knows that. So this decides the range, and it
exists as its own file because the decision had a defect that a shell fragment
inside a workflow could not be tested for.

The defect: a branch creation reports the all-zero before-sha, and the fallback
for that case scanned the last fifty commits reachable from HEAD. Fifty commits of
HEAD is not what the push added -- on a new branch cut from the default branch it
is almost entirely the default branch's own history. Every new branch was
therefore scanned against history it did not introduce, and refused for a defect
already present on the default branch, which only a rewrite of published history
can clear. A sibling repository hit it on 2026-09-20: two hits eleven commits
behind the branch point, in commits the push did not contain.

What the push adds, on a branch creation, is the commits the default branch does
not already have. That is a range, and this resolves it.

The other half of the defect is quieter and is the reason for `count` below. A
range that resolves to no commits makes the scanner print "0 commit(s) scanned,
clean" and exit 0, so a mis-resolved range does not fail -- it passes, having read
nothing. An empty range is therefore never accepted here: it falls back to the
bounded scan, which is a bound and never a pass.

    scripts/push-scan-range.py             # print the scanner's arguments
    scripts/push-scan-range.py --selftest  # prove every arm of the decision

Read from the environment, because that is the shape the event arrives in:

    PR_BASE         base sha of a pull request, when the event is one
    PUSH_BEFORE     sha the remote held before the push; all-zero on creation
    DEFAULT_BRANCH  the repository's default branch name

Exit codes:
    0  the arguments were printed on stdout
    2  could not decide, which is never a pass
