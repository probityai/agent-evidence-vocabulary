"""Tests for the owner-path permit in pre-push-identity-scan.py.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The scanner refuses first-party names in this public,
product-neutral repository. The organisation that owns the repository is named
in its own clone URL, its badge targets and its citation file, and a URL cannot
avoid naming its owner, so one narrow permit was added: the handle passes where
a slash and one of the three repository names follow it, and nowhere else.

A permit on a refusal is the one change that can only ever loosen, and a
loosening that goes unnoticed is indistinguishable from the control working. So
every case below asserts a direction. The permitted shapes are here to prove the
push is possible at all; the refused ones are the point, and they outnumber them.

The tokens are built from hex at run time, exactly as the scanner holds its own,
so this file can be read by anyone without carrying the strings it is about.

Usage: python3 scripts/pre-push-identity-scan-test.py
Exit 0 when every case holds; 1 on a summary of the failures.
