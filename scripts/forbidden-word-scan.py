"""Refuse any tracked file containing a word from the salted-hash sidecar.

Companion to the commit-msg hook: the hook covers commit messages, this covers
file contents. Both read `.githooks/commit-msg.forbidden-words`, so there is
one list and no way for the two surfaces to drift apart.

    scripts/forbidden-word-scan.py            # every tracked file
    scripts/forbidden-word-scan.py path ...   # only these

Exit codes are three-valued on purpose, because "found nothing" and "could not
look" must never print the same way:

    0  scanned, nothing found
    1  scanned, at least one hit
    2  did not scan -- missing or malformed sidecar, or git unavailable

A missing sidecar is exit 2, not exit 0. A guard whose rule list failed to load
has not verified anything, and reporting that as clean is how a check quietly
stops being a check. This one scans its own rule file too: there is no plaintext
in it to exempt, which is the whole reason the list is hashed.
