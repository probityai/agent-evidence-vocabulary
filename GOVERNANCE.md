# Governance

This document binds every maintainer of this repository, including its founding maintainer. It
exists to make the registry trustworthy to a party who has no reason to trust any single
contributor, the one who started it included.

## What this registry does and does not do

This registry names terms. It does not certify implementations, does not endorse any product, and
does not adjudicate disputes about whose product is "better." A term appearing here with your
system listed as an issuer means one thing: your system emits a value for that term, in a real
running artifact, and you have filed a crosswalk saying so. It is not an endorsement.

## No self-grounding exemption

**A maintainer's own product receives no special standing.** A crosswalk filed by a maintainer for
their own system goes through the identical review any other filing gets. An independent reviewer,
never the maintainer who filed it, confirms before merge that the cited `source_path` resolves and
carries the declared value. This binds the founding maintainer's own systems without exception,
meaning the adversarial-execution-evidence predicate, abbreviated AEE, and its reference
verifier.

## Merge discipline

One rule is absolute and never depends on how many maintainers exist:

- **Every crosswalk gets an independent evidence check before merge.** The reviewer fetches the
  cited `source_path` and confirms it resolves to the declared value. A crosswalk citing a path
  that does not resolve is not merged, regardless of who filed it, and a maintainer never reviews
  a filing for a system they have a declared interest in. This is what the registry's claims rest
  on, and no count of maintainers loosens it.

Two more bind from the moment a second row exists in MAINTAINERS.md, and they arm themselves with
nothing to switch on:

- No maintainer merges their own pull request.
- No direct pushes to `main`. Every change goes through a pull request with CI green.

**With one maintainer those two would mean nothing merges at all, so they do not apply yet, and
this document says so where a reader will find it.** Changes reach `main` both ways today: as direct
pushes, and through pull requests the founding maintainer opens and merges himself. Those two rules
forbid both routes the day a second maintainer is listed. That is the honest state of a
registry built by one person, and it costs the reader nothing: the rule their trust
actually depends on is the first one, and that one has never been relaxed.

The single rule guards a single failure, and it is not fraud. A registry usually starts as one
person's careful work, and that person is normally its most rigorous participant. The gap opens
where rigor is not mechanically enforced, and the place that reliably escapes enforcement is the
maintainer's own entry, because reviewing it is the one review nobody is available for.

So it binds here first. The declared interest covers one system, so a filing from anyone else has a
conflict-free reviewer today; a filing from that system does not, and waits. Promotion needs an
emitter that is not us. Every cited path is fetched by hand before a merge, ours included.

The measurable consequence at 0.2.0 is that not one term here is canonical, because our own issuer
does not count toward a promotion and the one crosswalk filed so far, aee-e2's, is a verifier's,
which emits no value. Version 0.1.0 was different: six terms
carried canonical status on our own issuer alone. That tag is still reachable, so both halves of
this paragraph can be checked against the repository. Those six carried no crosswalk behind them,
the exact defect a listing must not carry under the rule above. Nobody had filed one then either.

Demoting those six is the evidence, and the current state is not. A rule that has never had to move
against the person who wrote it has not yet been tested.

## Promotion and demotion

A term starts as proposed. Promotion to canonical requires one independently-maintained system that
is not us to file a crosswalk declaring `evidence: emitted` with a resolvable path, verified by an
independent reviewer per the merge discipline above. Our own issuer never counted toward it, so the
bar is a first qualifying emitter and not a second one. One issuer, however large, does not promote
a term.

Every proposed term carries a review-by date. If no qualifying issuer that is not us has surfaced
by that date, the term is demoted to reserved. It is removed at the next review-by date
set on it, unless a production issuer surfaces first. A demoted term moves into the reserved block at
the foot of `vocabulary.yaml` and is not silently deleted. That block takes two kinds of row and
each says which it is: a term explicitly declined before it was ever proposed, and a term that was
proposed and found none. It is empty at 0.2.0, because no review-by date has come round yet.

## Conflict of interest

Any maintainer with a commercial or research interest in a system that has filed, or is considering
filing, discloses it in MAINTAINERS.md and does not review that system's filings at all. Not as sole
reviewer, not alongside another. This is the same bar CONTRIBUTING.md and MAINTAINERS.md state.

## Committer access

Committer access is granted on a sustained maintenance record, meaning reviewing other people's
crosswalks accurately over time. Filing one earns none, and running the validator once earns none.

Nobody holds that record yet, the founding maintainer included. One crosswalk has been filed and
reviewed, aee-e2's, and one review is not a sustained record. The first person to earn committer
access here will earn it that way. Stated plainly so a reader testing the rule against the repository finds the answer
already written down.

## Amending this document

A change that weakens the crosswalk evidence check needs a stated reason and a 14-day open comment
window before it lands, whatever the maintainer count is. That rule is the registry's whole claim,
so it is the one change nobody makes quietly, and the window applies to the person who wrote it as
much as to anyone else.

Everything else in this file follows the merge discipline above: direct while there is one
maintainer, second-maintainer merge from the moment there are two.
